Images (trained on ImageNet?) to ``concepts'' (CNN)
Video to dialogue via concepts (in order to train the concept-dialogue connection) -> possibly also need a dialogue-concept classifier (ideally with images)
Possibly topic modelling for dialogue
Using novels for corpus? (Words surrounding the dialogue may help with context to infer the concepts involved)

We will then have a mapping from images to concepts, and from concepts to dialogues/quotes.  We then would want to train (possibly via RL) a ``scrambler'' that maps an image concept to a different concept, so that given an image, the complete system will generate a ``caption'' (bit of dialogue) that corresponds to some concept that is related in a funny way to the source image concept.

Computer vision to compute image to sketching

We will also want to be able to generate images related to concepts, and to hybridize images between concepts (perhaps only at the sketch level - combine elements from one thing into the other)

Tasks:
* Corpus collection
* Deep learning architecture
